|product-name| |product-version| System Specification
#####################################################

|product-name| is a remote :term:`code execution system`.
It is inspired by projects like `Piston <piston-repo_>`_ and `Judge0 <judge0-repo_>`_.
That said, |product-name| aims to be more general-purpose and extensible
by allowing the users to run their code with arbitrary :term:`dependencies` (:ref:`see how it works <how-it-works>`).
