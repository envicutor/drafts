|product-name| System Specification
===================================

|product-name| is a remote :term:`code execution system`.
It is inspired by projects like `Piston <piston-repo_>`_ and `Judge0 <judge0-repo_>`_.
That said, |product-name| aims to be more general-purpose by providing the users with the ability to run their code in
an arbitrary :term:`execution environment` of their specification (:ref:`see how it works <how-it-works>`).
