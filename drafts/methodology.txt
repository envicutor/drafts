- Iterative, or exploratory (as in some literature), development
  - Refining (dynamically testing) the abstractions made in the specification helps avoid:
    - Ambiguities:
      - Developer states abstraction "a"
      - Developer states abstraction "c" depending on abstraction "a" and an implicit abstraction "b"
        - The developer's mind wrongly assumed abstraction "b" has already been defined
    - Contradictions:
      - Developer states abstraction "a"
      - Developer states abstraction "b" depending on an implicit contradiction of abstraction "a"
        - The developer's mind oversaw the contradiction
    - Impossible to refine abstractions:
      - Developer states abstraction "a" which violates logic
        - The developer's mind oversaw the violation

- Form the abstractions
- Refine the abstractions (#)
- Fix the abstractions
- Extend the abstractions
- Repeat at (#)
