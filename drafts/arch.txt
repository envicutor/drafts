- Set up environment
- Build additional dependencies
- Compile code
- Run code

- Env received as shell.nix
- Nix build shell.nix
- Docker build base image
- Docker run base image execute()

- Micro-services
  - Shared disk: contains /nix directory, shared with Executor and Cache builder
  - Stores: submissions store, requests queue, cache queue
  - Requests handler: get requests from user, put requests metadata in requests queue and submissions store
  - Executor: polls requests queue, sets up environment, puts environment metadata in cache queue, executes request,
    modifies submission in submissions store
  - Cache builder: polls cache queue, builds the environment from environment metadata to be cached in shared volume

- Iteration 1 activity flow:
  - Client
    - Sends execute request
  - Requests handler:
    - Puts request's metadata in requests queue
    - Creates a new submission in the submission store
  - Executor:
    - Finds the request's metadata in the requests queue after polling
    - Creates a docker container from the base image
    - Run the container to build the nix environment
    - Update the submission in the submissions store with the environment build result
    - If environment got built successfully
      - Run the container to execute the build script (if any)
        - Update submission in submission store with the build result
      - [If build is successful or None] Run the container to execute the compile script (if any)
        - Update submission in submissions store with the compile result
      - [If build and/or compile are successful or None] Run the container to execute the run script
        - Update submission in submissions store with the run result
    - Remove the docker container
  - Client
    - Sends get submission request
  - Request handler
    - Retrieves submission from the submissions store
    - Sends it to the client
