- Future iterations
  - Large test cases
  - Endpoint for garbage collection
  - Move nix shell when installing instead of re-writing
  - Cache compiled programs using hash
  - Implement bounds on limits
  - Optionally take id for adding runtime and make sure it does not exist
  - Get runtime info endpoint to help in distributed systems consistency
  - CI on packages
    - A repo that includes request templates with CI automated tests run on them to ensure their integrity
      - Users can fork their repository and have their own CI tests
  - Limit overrides
  - Interactive execution
  - Max stdout and stderr size
  - Ensure all boxes and tempdirs are cleaned on startup?
  - API key?
  - Ensure nix shell does not enter an infinite shell hook loop
  - CI/CD
  - Test update nix concurrency
  - How to handle large request bodies in queue?
    - Limit queue size and return "queue full"
    - Websockets and only accept data from client once a queue spot is ready (notifying the client once one is ready)
    - Distributed systems request handler while limiting the number of concurrent tasks on workers
