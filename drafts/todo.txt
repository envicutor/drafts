- Read documents as a new person
- Get rid of env in Submission object
- Add cache boolean in submission request
- Let user provide shell.nix
- Flow that describes what happens once a worker is started (cleaning up stuck files)
- Submission on disk, lease in memory
- SubmissionsStore -> Database, InMemoryStore
- CacheBuilder -> CacheServer
- Use a proper component diagram generator?
- Do new architecture
  - Remove CacheBuilderHealthChecker
  - Send shell.nix directly to the CacheServer?
    - From RequestHandler?
      - This removes some responsibilities from the Worker
    - From Worker?
      - This gives me a chance to send shell.nix conditionally if dependencies installation succeeded
  - Consider separating CacheServer container
    - Separating
      - Docker server (needs access to the nix store for accessing the daemon)
      - Nix daemon server (needs access to the nix store for serving the daemon and storing the built stuff)
      - Handler
    - No separating
      - Use systemd for ensuring health
  - Ability to not cache

- Create worker child image prototype
- Create worker image prototype
- Test executing code
