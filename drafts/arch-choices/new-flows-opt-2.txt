- nix-shell --run worker_program
  - How to timeout nix-shell?
  - Worker program shall say: I'M READY
    - Parent process will then stop the timeout timer
    - What about memory limits?

- Opt 1: running nix-shell without running nix-shell
- Opt 2: not running nix-shell, having compile_script, run_script
- Root of the problem: we are not sure what nix-shell is going to do (it might exceed the limits)

- Dependencies installation stage
  - nsjail nix-shell
- After dependencies installation stage (compile, run)
  - nix-shell, without nsjail, worker program which uses nsjail
