- Opt1
  - Architecture if we want the dependencies specified during submission
    - CacheServers uses nix-serve to serve its nix-store
      - Workers have the CacheServers as substituters (caches that substitute the main remote cache (cache.nixos.org)).
      - Extra flexibility if you want to build a system that provides a playground in which users can provide their own
        nix expression
        - Is caching user-specified nix expressions wasteful?
          - Even if it is wasteful, the client can prevent normal users from specifying the nix-shell
- Opt2
  - Architecture if we want to separate dependencies installations and submissions
    - There is a central server that builds the dependencies to a nix store that is mounted read-only on the workers
    - The same as Piston/Judge0 but allowing the installation of dependencies on-the-fly
