  Code execution system
  Code execution engine
    A back-end system that lives in the cloud.
    It takes a request containing information about certain code to execute: language, source code, files, etc.
    and returns the result after (or, in some cases, during) executing the code.

  Execution environment
    The set of packages (programming language compilers, execution tools, etc.) that are available during execution,
    their configuration and the executing user's environment variables.

    .. note::

      This term does not refer to the operating system on which the code is executed.
